        <p>
          About 2.3 million years ago our ancestors invented their first
          primitive tool, the split stone, which they used for cutting and
          scraping. Modern humans first appeared about 200,000 years ago. About
          50,000 years ago they (or should that be we?) began to use language,
          symbols, and more complex tools. As inventions and discoveries added
          to one another, human civilization, technology, and science advanced
          and evolved.

          <h2>Most Famous Scientists and Inventors in History</h2>
          <p>
            The beginnings of science and the scientific method largely came
            from the ancient Greek world, which encompassed the eastern part of
            the Mediterranean. The names of the great scientists and
            philosophers of that time, such as Pythagoras, Archimedes,
            Aristotle, Eratosthenes and Thales, are still known today, over
            2,000 years later.

          <h2>The Era of Modern Science Begins</h2>
          <p>
            Science entered a new era with the Renaissance, which began in 14th
            century Italy. By the 17th century it had extended and blossomed
            throughout most of Europe. The fall of Constantinople in 1453
            resulted in a large number of refugees fleeing to Europe, bringing
            with them Greek and Roman books that had been archived in
            Constantinople, unused for centuries. This, and the invention of the
            printing press in about 1450 accelerated the pace of learning in
            Renaissance Europe. Unfortunately for science, only a few people
            thirsted for scientific knowledge and progress, while most
            intellectuals focused on artistic or liberal arts disciplines. It
            was only in the 17th century that a rapid scientific revolution
            finally took place.
