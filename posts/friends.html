        <p>
          his American series from the 90s is one of the most popular one.
          Furthermore, even it is no more in production it is often diffused. In
          fact, it is, even today, one of the favorite series of the youngers
          generations. But, why everyone is so in love with Friends? Who are
          they? Friends is the story of 6 friends who are very close from each
          other. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are the women of the group. Ross,
          Chandler and Joey are the men. But, Rachel is also the girlfriend of
          Ross at the end. Furthermore, Monica and Chandler marry in the series

          <h2>Why the series Friends is so famous?</h2>
          <p>
            Why does it work? This series is genius for a lot of different
            reasons. Firstly, it is sooooo funny. In fact, in each episode humor
            seems to be the key word. Secondly, the connecting link between the
            characters is very strong and beautiful. Indeed, the audience is
            hoping to have a bunch of friends like this through every episode.
            To finish, the fact that this series is made of short episodes which
            is easier to watch from the beginning to the end of an episode.

          <h2>Characters</h2>
          <p>
            These characters are simple with no extra fluff. The initially
            spoilt and privileged daddy’s girl Rachel who left her marriage at
            the altar and started her journey being a central perk (coffee
            house) waitress, ultimately comes out to be the most considerate
            person, the mother hen of the group. Perfectionist and neat freak -
            Monica (who cleans a toilet 12 times a day even when isn’t
            required). The eccentric hippie Phoebe, who has all the weirdness of
            the world and God knows how many languages she can speak. She done
            pretty much every crazy thing you can imagine from selling barrettes
            on the streets to giving birth to triplets who in fact are children
            of her step brother and his wife. Ross is a nerdy paleontologist and
            his first wife turns out to be a lesbian, during the second marriage
            ceremony he utters the wrong name at the altar which leaves him
            facing singlehood with phenomenal reluctance. Despite everything he
            still believes in love. Joey is a struggling actor(giftedly bad at
            that) attractive, macho, smug yet dumb and adorable. He lives across
            the hall from Monica and Rachel and he can gulp down an entire
            turkey in a single sitting (and he’s not fat). Chandler is a wry
            observer of everyone’s life and his own, his father is gay and
            mother - a sexiest writer (no pun intended). He survives by virtue
            of his sense of humor. His profession is a mystery till date.
