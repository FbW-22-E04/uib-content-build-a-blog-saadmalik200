          <h2>What Is Biryani?</h2>
          <p>
            Biryani is a South Asian one-pot dish in which lamb, mutton, beef,
            chicken, seafood, or a mixture of vegetables is layered with rice.
            The layering technique is what differentiates biryani from other
            rice dishes, like a pilaf or pulao. There are a couple of different
            ways to prepare biryani. Sometimes the raw meat is cooked with the
            rice; this is called the "kacchi" method (kacchi is Hindi for
            "raw"). In others, the meat is cooked separately, as I do in this
            recipe; this is called the "pakki" method (pakki is Hindi for
            "cooked"). Regardless of the method, aromas are infused into the
            meat and the rice using a combination of spices, herbs, and
            extracts, while saffron threads and turmeric add bright hues of
            orange and yellow to the otherwise white backdrop of long-grain
            rice. The result is a highly aromatic and colorful dish of meat and
            rice. There are a lot of variations of biryani—like Bombay biryani,
            Hyderbadi biryani, etc.—as recipes and taste preferences can be
            quite different from region to region and even household to
            household.

          <h2>How to make Biryani</h2>
          <p>
            Chicken marinated in a spiced yoghurt is placed in a large pot, then
            layered with fried onions (cheeky easy sub below!), fresh
            coriander/cilantro, then par boiled lightly spiced rice. The
            crowning glory is to finish it off with a drizzle of saffron infused
            water to give it the signature patches of bright yellow rice, as
            well as ghee (or melted butter) for buttery richness. The pot is
            then covered and cooked over a low heat for about 25 minutes during
            which time the rice absorbs the aromas and flavours of the curry
            underneath, whilst still being beautifully fluffy.

            That moment when you lift the lid and are greeted with this sight…
          </p>

          <p>
            …. that moment is only second to this: when you dig deep into the
            pot, ensuring you get some of every layer, and the full force of the
            aroma from the curry buried deep under the rice hits you, and it
            takes every single bit of will power to gravitate that spoon towards
            a bowl instead of attempting to shove that entire giant scoop in
            your mouth….
