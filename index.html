            Biryani is a South Asian one-pot dish in which lamb, mutton, beef,
            chicken, seafood, or a mixture of vegetables is layered with rice.
            The layering technique is what differentiates biryani from other
            rice dishes, like a pilaf or pulao.

            About 2.3 million years ago our ancestors invented their first
            primitive tool, the split stone, which they used for cutting and
            scraping. Modern humans first appeared about 200,000 years ago.
            About 50,000 years ago they (or should that be we?) began to use
            language, symbols, and more complex tools. As inventions and
            discoveries added to one another, human civilization, technology,
            and science advanced and evolved.
